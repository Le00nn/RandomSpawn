Reloads the config.yml file

/rs set
Sets a range of positions (X and Z coordinates) of which you can spawn in.

    /rs set x x1 x2
    This will set the spawn x position to be between x1 and x2 (x1 and x2 must be integers, meaning no float values are allowed).

    /rs set z z1 z2
    This will set the spawn z position to be between z1 and z2 (z1 and z2 must be integers, meaning no float values are allowed).

    Failure to set the positions x and z correctly may result in error or plugin ignoring putting players at random spawn.
